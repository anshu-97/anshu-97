# Hello ðŸ‘‹ #

Iâ€™m An Shu! I am a Psychology Graduate from NUS currently working as a Research Assistant at Clinical Brain Lab in NTU!

### About Me ###
Interests ðŸ‘€
- I am interested in clinical psychology, particularly in studying the interactions between interoceptive skills and dysfunctions in emotional regulatory and self-control processes in children!
  I also have some interest in understanding psychopathology of criminals and the psychosomatic effect of trauma.

Iâ€™m currently learning ðŸŒ± ...
- Neurophysiological signal processing, specifically with regards to deception and perception of reality. Also trying to learn Python and R ðŸ™ƒ
  I hope to be able to apply for Graduate Studies in Clinical Psychology and study more about the psychopathological mechanisms as well as neurophysiological correlates underlying emotion regulation disorders and obsessive destructive behaviours.

Other Geeky Likes ðŸ’“
- Besides my research and clinical interests, I am also an avid fan of Disney and musicals which means you can expect to see me spending my free time re-watching Mulan or sing-shout along to Hamilton and Les Miz ðŸŽ¶
